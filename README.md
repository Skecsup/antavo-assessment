# Real-time Inventory Management System

## Design Choices & Implementation Strategy

### State Management

- Implemented client-side state using React's useState for immediate UI updates
- Utilized optimistic updates for better user experience
- Maintained separate states for items and conflicts
- Used TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability

### Synchronization Strategy

- Implemented 1-second polling interval for real-time updates
- Used optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Maintained lastUpdated timestamp for version control
- Implemented efficient delta updates to minimize data transfer

### Conflict Resolution Approach

The system handles concurrent modifications through:

- Real-time conflict detection using version comparison
- Clear conflict visualization via modal interface
- User choice between server and client versions
- Automatic state rollback on failed updates

## Advantages

1. **User Experience**

   - Immediate feedback through optimistic updates
   - Clear conflict resolution interface
   - Minimal UI disruption

2. **Performance**
   - Reduced server load through polling
   - Efficient state updates
   - Optimized network usage

## Limitations

1. **Synchronization**

   - 1-second polling interval may miss rapid changes
   - Potential for brief data inconsistency
   - Network-dependent conflict resolution

2. **Scalability**
   - Memory usage increases with item count
   - Polling might not scale well with many clients
   - Limited offline capabilities

## Improvement Opportunities

1. **Technical Enhancements**

   - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Add offline support through Service Workers
   - Implement automatic conflict resolution for minor differences

2. **User Experience**

   - Add conflict prevention mechanisms
   - Implement merge strategies for concurrent updates
   - Add undo/redo functionality

3. **Performance**
   - Implement selective polling based on item activity
   - Add data compression for updates
   - Implement progressive loading for large inventories
